## Introduction to `dplyr`

### `tidyverse`

> It is often said that 80% of data analysis is spent on the process of cleaning and preparing the data.

> Dasu and Johnson, 2003

For most applied researchers, data preparation usually involves 3 main steps:

1. **Transforming** data frames, e.g., filtering, summarizing, and conducting calculations across groups.
2. **Tidying** data into the appropriate format.
3. **Merging** or linking several datasets to create a bigger dataset.

The [`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org/) is a suite of packages designed specifically to help with these steps. These are by no means the only packages out there for data wrangling, but they are increasingly popular for their readable, straightforward syntax and sensible default behaviors.

In this chapter, we are going to focus on how to use the `dplyr` package for data transformation tasks.

For this unit, we will be working with the Gapminder dataset again.

```{r message=F}
library(tidyverse)
library(gapminder)

gap <- gapminder
head(gap)
```

### Why `dplyr`?

If you have ever used base R before, you know the following will calculate the mean GDP per capita within each region:

```{r message=FALSE}
mean(gap$gdpPercap[gap$continent == "Africa"])
mean(gap$gdpPercap[gap$continent == "Americas"])
mean(gap$gdpPercap[gap$continent == "Asia"])
```

But this is not ideal because it involves a fair bit of repetition. Repeating yourself will cost you time, both now and later, and potentially introduce some nasty bugs.

Luckily, the [`dplyr`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/dplyr.pdf) package provides a number of very useful functions for manipulating dataframes. These functions will save you time by reducing repetition. As an added bonus, you might even find the `dplyr` grammar easier to read.

Here, we are going to cover 7 of the most commonly used `dplyr` functions. We will also cover pipes (`%>%`), which are used to combine those functions.

1. `select()`
2. `filter()`
3. `mutate()`
4. `arrange()`
5. `count()`
6. `group_by()`
7. `summarize()`
8. `mutate()`

If you have not installed `tidyverse`, please do so now:

```{r,eval=FALSE}
# not run
# install.packages('tidyverse')
require(tidyverse)
```


### Select Columns with `select`

Imagine that we have just received the Gapminder dataset, but are only interested in a few variables in it. We could use the `select()` function to keep only the variables we select.

```{r}
year_country_gdp <- select(gap, year, country, gdpPercap)
head(year_country_gdp)
```

```{r echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "img/dplyr-fig1.png")
```

If we open up `year_country_gdp`, we will see that it only contains the `year`, `country`, and `gdpPercap`. This is equivalent to the base R subsetting function:

```{r}
year_country_gdp_base <- gap[,c("year", "country", "gdpPercap")]
head(year_country_gdp)
```

### The Pipe

```{r echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "img/pipe.jpg")
```

Above, we used what is called 'normal' grammar, but the strengths of `dplyr` lie in combining several functions using *pipes*.

In typical base R code, a simple operation might be written like: 

```{r eval=F}
# NOT run
cupcakes <- bake(pour(mix(ingredients)))
```

A computer has no trouble understanding this, and your cupcakes will be made just fine, but a person has to read right to left to understand the order of operations -- the opposite of how most Western languages are read -- making it harder to understand what is being done! 

To be more readable without pipes, we might break up this code into intermediate objects: 

```{r, eval = F}
## NOT run
batter <- mix(ingredients)
muffin_tin <- pour(batter)
cupcakes <- bake(muffin_tin)
```

But this can clutter our environment with a lot of variables that are not very useful to us. Plus, these variables are often named very similar things (e.g., step, step1, step2...), which can lead to confusion and the creation of hard-to-track-down bugs. 

#### Enter the Pipe... {-}

The *pipe* makes it easier to read code by laying out operations from left to right -- each line can be read like a line of a recipe for the perfect data frame! 

Pipes take the input on the left side of the `%>%` symbol and pass it in as the first argument to the function on the right side.

With pipes, our cupcake example might be written like:

```{r, eval=F}
## NOT run
cupcakes <- ingredients %>% 
  mix() %>% 
  pour() %>% 
  bake()
```

#### `select` & Pipe (`%>%`) {-}

Let's repeat what we did above with the Gapminder dataset using pipes:

```{r}
year_country_gdp <- gap %>% 
  select(year, country, gdpPercap)
```

First, we summon the gapminder data frame and pass it on to the next step using the pipe symbol `%>%`.

The second step is the `select()` function. In this case, we do not specify which data object we use in the call to `select()` since we have piped it in from the previous line.

#### Tips for Piping {-}

1. Remember that you do not assign anything within the pipes --- that is, you should not use `<-` inside the piped operation. Only use `<-` at the beginning of your code if you want to save the output.

2. Remember to add the pipe `%>%` at the end of each line involved in the piped operation. A good rule of thumb: since RStudio will automatically indent lines of code that are part of a piped operation, if the line is not indented, it probably has not been added to the pipe. If you have an error in a piped operation, always check to make sure the pipe is connected as you expect.

3. In RStudio, the hotkey for the pipe is `Ctrl + Shift + M`. 

### Filter Rows with `filter`

Now let's say we are only interested in African countries. We can combine `select` and `filter` to select only the observations where `continent` is `Africa`.

```{r}
year_country_gdp_africa <- gap %>%
    filter(continent == "Africa") %>%
    select(year, country, gdpPercap)
```

As with last time, first we pass the gapminder dataframe to the `filter()` function, then we pass the filtered version of the Gapminder dataframe to the `select()` function.

To clarify, both the `select` and `filter` functions subset the data frame. The difference is that `select` extracts certain columns, while `filter` extracts certain rows.

**NB**: The order of operations is very important in this case. If we used `select` first, `filter` would not be able to find the variable `continent`, since we would have removed it in the previous step.
